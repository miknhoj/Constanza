# Costanza !- WDI: Project 4

## Overview
My project idea was inspired by a my several trips to New York City. Whenever I went to visit New York City, I always found it difficult to find a nice, clean bathroom to use while exploring the city. Also, inspired by a Seinfeld episode where George Costanza shows his ability to find the best public toilet anywhere in New York City. It is essentially a Yelp for bathrooms. You can add bathrooms to the database and give it a rating. You can also use the google maps api to find public locations near you. Unfortunately, at this time, this app is still a work in progress.

## The Process
I started with setting up the backend using Rails with Postgresql. I built out the frontend with React to test the seed data. Then I worked on bringing the the 3rd-party apis.

## Challenges
This project was very challenging, because I kept getting tripped on simple bugs that delayed the whole project. By the time I decided I need to get my 3rd-Party api into my project - I ran into a host of more problems, so I ended up with a very unpolished, unfinished project. I learned that working with 3rd Party api's are going to create a lot of new challenges.

## Shout Outs
GA Staff - Daniel and Andrew, MOON!(my personal debugger and also helping me with setting up my API), Ivy (Great Rails set up instructions), Qing, and everyone at the back table that took time to talk me off the edge. And of course, Postman.

## Work In Progress
I hope to get my 3rd party api's fully functional with my app. Future goals: be able to input my location so that the FourSquare api will bring nearby public restrooms into the app and Google Maps API will mark them on the map.
