# Costanza !- WDI: Project 4

## Overview
My project idea was inspired by a my several trips to New York City. Whenever I went to visit New York City, I always found it difficult to find a nice, clean bathroom to use while exploring the city. Also, inspired by a Seinfeld episode where George Costanza shows his ability to find the best public toilet anywhere in New York City. It is essentially a Yelp for bathrooms. You can add bathrooms to the database and give it a rating. You can also use the google maps api to find public locations near you. Unfortunately, at this time, this app is still a work in progress.
